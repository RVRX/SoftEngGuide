# Installing Java

## Checking Current Java Version

Chances are, you already have java installed on your computer. You still want to have the most up to date version of Java 8

To determine what version of java you have, run this command in a terminal 

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_281"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_281-b09)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.281-b09, mixed mode)
```
