# Installing Java

## Checking Current Java Version

Chances are, you already have java installed on your computer. You still want to have the most up to date version of Java 13

To determine what version of java you have, run this command in a terminal 

```bash
$ java -version
openjdk version "13.0.2" 2020-01-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 13.0.2+8)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 13.0.2+8, mixed mode, sharing)
```

> :information_source: When you see $ command written like that, it usually means it is in a shell prompt. Don't copy the $ when typing it out.

As of writing this, the latest version is 13.0.2 . If the aforementioned command doesn't not say13.0.2 then you'll want to update.

> :information_source: While 13.0.0 will work fine, it's always a good idea to have the latest version.
