# Gradle

Gradle is an open-source build tool that allows us to easily manage dependencies for our java applications and compile them together without frustration.

The start code contains a `build.gradle` file that should suit your needs, but you will need to add dependencies to gradle as your project becomes larger.

## Managing Dependencies

The Gradle Docs have a good writeup on [managing dependencies](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/building_java_projects.html#sec:java_dependency_management_overview). Everyone on the team should read over it before beginning Iteration 0.
