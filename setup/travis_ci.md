# Travis CI

Travis CI is an online build tool that can be used to perform testing of your code before you push it out to production. The default starter code for this class contains configuration files to automatically run all of the java tests, check formatting, and check code coverage. If any of these requirements are not met, then the build will fail and you won't be able to merge your code into the master branch.
